üìä Technical Observations

TypeError issue: Permanently resolved ‚Äî defensive JSON parsing verified.

Endpoint rotation: Working perfectly; mirrors distribute load evenly.

Subdivision: Adaptive quadtree triggered correctly on capped cells.

Telemetry: overpass_calls populated with structured JSON and timing metrics.

Rate control: All requests stayed within polite QPS limits.

Data quality: All locations rows normalized ‚Üí OSM_OVERPASS / CANDIDATE.

üß† Insights

OSM coverage proved strong for Turkish community businesses, especially restaurants, barbers, and mosques.

Some travel agencies and fast-food subtypes showed gaps ‚Äî likely due to missing shop=* or amenity=* tags.

Future enrichment may use AI name matching (e.g., ‚ÄúAnadolu‚Äù, ‚ÄúSaray‚Äù, ‚ÄúIstanbul‚Äù) to expand Turkish inference confidence.

üèó Next Steps
Phase	Objective	Notes
1Ô∏è‚É£ Refine Filters	Add Turkish keyword ‚Üí confidence boost heuristic	Reuse classifier hints
2Ô∏è‚É£ Scale to Cities	Run The Hague ‚Üí Amsterdam ‚Üí Utrecht sequentially	Reuse same config
3Ô∏è‚É£ Automation	Schedule Render cron (weekly discovery per city)	Use DATA_PROVIDER=osm
4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Verification	Re-run self_verify_bot with min confidence 0.85	Promote verified
5Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring Dashboard	Extend metrics service to visualize OSM coverage	Link to /metrics API
