# N4.2 – News Tab Navigation (Feeds)

## What changed
- Added a segmented tab bar above the `/news` list using `Tabs`, exposing feeds:
  `diaspora`, `nl`, `tr`, `local`, `origin`, `geo`, `trending`.
- Selected feed is stored in the hash query (`#/news?feed=<key>`) and restored on
  refresh/back navigation.
- `useNewsFeed` keeps a 60s in-memory cache per feed/page-size to avoid
  redundant first-page requests when switching tabs quickly.

## URL contract
- Path remains `/news` under `HashRouter`.
- Query parameter `feed=<NewsFeedKey>` is required for explicit feeds; when
  omitted the UI defaults to `feed=diaspora` and immediately writes it back.
- Hash query updates preserve any additional params.

## Caching behaviour
- Cache key: `<feed>:<pageSize>` (currently `pageSize=20`).
- Scope: first page (`offset=0`) responses only.
- TTL: 60 seconds; manual reload clears the cache entry for the active feed.
- Hash-driven navigation (back/forward) will reuse cached data when still warm.

## Future notes
- Icons/badges per feed and empty-state copy per tab are candidates for later.
- Consider persisting last feed choice (e.g. localStorage) if we expose `/news`
  in non-hash contexts.
